And it is because you gave me the right to an education that I now have a voice to say farewell to you. For that, I will be forever grateful. In my last words, know that I was just trying to make the Holy Nation a better place, for my daughter and for all women. \r\n\r\nAre you happy to never know true love, but only the empty obedience of a servant \u0027wife\u0027? Is it so wrong to want to be treated as an equal? Not to be condemned before I have even sinned? This madness needs to end. But how many more women need to die before that change can happen?\r\n\r\nEva\u0022",

We\u0027re accused of cruelty, accused of stealing people\u0027s freedom. Yet the accusers continue to buy the products and labours of slavery: Iron, cotton, chainmail... ninja rags. The accusers reek of hypocrisy. But, even if slavery is immoral, it is ours alone to shoulder, not the business of others to interfere. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nNevertheless, a system so fruitful is everything but immoral. Slavery blesses us with wealth, with luxury, with food on our plates. If it weren\u0027t for our slaves, who would toil in the fields? Our resources would be wasted on us. With slavery we can appreciate and utilize our arable soils, our abundant minerals and our fair climate.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWe are what we are because of slavery.\u0022",

Homeless in Empire society, they were treated as an unwanted burden and hastily sold into slavery. Beaten, starved and worked to exhaustion after a year in the mines, the hardship finally took it\u0027s toll on Luquin\u0027s father. He eventually succumbed to his fatigue, leaving Luquin\u0027s mother heartbroken and bitter.\r\r\n\r\r\nWith nothing left to lose, mother Luquin was determined for a life of normality for her son, so she hatched an escape plan. One night, she came for Luquin and freed him from his cage during a commotion. The two of them fled to the outside of the camp until, suddenly, they were intercepted by one of the slaver guards. The brave mother threw herself onto the guard, his sword piercing through her torso. She yelled and screamed for Luquin to run as she gouged at the guard\u0027s eyes, blood streaming from her wound. \r\r\n\r\r\nLuquin ran towards the barren outlands with tear-filled eyes, never looking behind...\u0022",

First off, I spilt my veggie bowl on noble Yoshinaga\u0027s robes, managed to hightail it across the sands all the way to Stack with a trail of angry samurai on my back. Then! Then I only go and speak to the high priest \u0027before being spoken to\u0027, and, boy, he was not happy with me. \n\nI tried to hightail it out of Stack at that point, but tore my rags on the Phoenix\u0027 statue and bore my \u0027heinous udders\u0027 for all to see. Honestly, at that point, I was pretty irritated at having my sweet greenfruits referred to as udders, so I stuck \u0027em the middle finger and yelled every curseword under the sun. I got thrown in a prison cage and conveniently broken out by a fellow ninja inmate two weeks later. But how could I live easy with two of the most powerful world factions hating my guts, you ask? Well, I did what I do whenever I need something fixed. I paid a guy in a bar to make my problems go away. \n\nAnyway, what\u0027s my point in this long-winded story? My point, friend, is that no matter what kind of bad day you\u0027re having, all problems can be solved!... With money. Otherwise you\u0027re pretty screwed. \n\nSo here it is, a directory I\u0027ve compiled of all faction pacifiers and their locations for when you\u0027re having that particularly bad day week:\n\nHoly Nation Pacifier: Shark\nTraders Guild Pacifier: Blister Hill\nShek Kingdom Pacifier: World\u0027s End\nUnited Cities Pacifier: Lagoon\nSlave Traders: Stoat\nHounds Pacifier: Hub\nFlotsam Pacifier: Squin\nAnti Slaver Pacifier: Mud Town\n\nGood luck, troublemaker.\nYara",

It may not be completely accurate, time passes, shopkeepers get eaten by cannibals and so on.

Black Scratch is good too.\n\nARMOUR:\nHeft is the best place I found.  Can\u0027t think of any other place, unless you count that stupid rumour about Armour King.\n\nROBOTICS:\nBlack Desert City again, has a great selection taken from dead Skeletons.\nMongrel is also a great source for robotics, high demand for legs there obviously...\nIf you are desperate you can always go to the Hivers for some cheap legs, it\u0027s better than crawling.\n\nBLUEPRINTS:\nThe library of Black Scratch is the place you want to go, they sell every book and blueprint known to man.",
